# PROJECT STATUS - CLEAN AND ORGANIZED

## Cleanup Actions Completed

1. Removed ALL emojis from Python code
2. Converted French elevation terms to English
3. Organized documentation into docs/ folder
4. Cleaned root directory (moved old checkpoints)
5. Removed backup files from scripts/
6. Created FILE_STRUCTURE.txt documentation
7. Created professional README.md

## Current Project State

### Root Directory
- main_multipollutants.py (training entry)
- submit_multipollutants_from_scratch_6pollutants.sh (SLURM script)
- checkpoint_best_val_loss_0.3552.ckpt (best model)
- README.md (project documentation)
- FILE_STRUCTURE.txt (detailed structure)

### Source Code (src/)
All Python files cleaned:
- No emojis
- English comments (French marked for review)
- Professional formatting maintained

### Verified Features

**Wind Scanning:** ACTIVE
- Enabled via parallel_patch_embed: true in config
- ParallelVarPatchEmbedWind class with enable_wind_scan=True
- Wind reordering applied automatically

**Terrain Attention:** ACTIVE (first block only)
- PhysicsGuidedBlock in first transformer block
- Elevation-based attention masking implemented
- Other 5 blocks use standard attention

## Remaining Considerations

### For Performance Optimization

1. **Extend terrain mask to all blocks?**
   - Currently: Only block 0 has terrain attention
   - Option: Extend to all 6 blocks
   - Need to test performance impact

2. **Normalization statistics**
   - Current: Based on limited data
   - Recommended: Recompute on full training set (2013-2016)
   - Impact: Better convergence

### For Code Quality

1. **French comments** - Marked, not auto-translated (safety)
2. **Type hints** - Could be added for better IDE support
3. **Docstrings** - Some could be enhanced

## Ready for Thesis

Project is now:
- Clean and professional
- Well-documented
- Properly organized
- Ready for academic presentation

## Next Steps

User decides:
- A) Run training as-is (innovations are active)
- B) Optimize further (extend terrain mask, fix normalization)
- C) Additional cleanup/refactoring
